# Twitter Bookmarks Scraper — Frame

## Source

> Start a new project. I want to create a simple program to scrape my historic Twitter bookmarks saving each as a markdown file in a designated folder. This should capture the entire thread (where relevant), and include any pictures (where relevant).

---

## Problem

- Twitter bookmarks accumulate over time but there's no built-in way to export or archive them
- Bookmarked tweets may disappear if accounts are deleted or tweets removed
- Thread context is lost when viewing individual bookmarks
- No offline access to bookmarked content

## Outcome

- All historic bookmarks are saved locally as individual markdown files
- Each bookmark preserves the full thread context (where applicable)
- All media (images, GIFs, video) is captured locally
- Content is organized in a designated folder, ready for offline reading or search
- Process is resumable — can stop and restart without re-downloading
